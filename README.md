# 📊 Layoffs SQL Data Analysis Project

This project focuses on analyzing large-scale layoffs in the tech industry using structured SQL queries. It includes **data cleaning**, **standardization**, and **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** to uncover insights from company layoffs.

---

## 📁 Files

- **Data Cleaning-Layoffs.sql**: Prepares the raw data by removing duplicates, cleaning nulls, fixing formats, and standardizing values.
- **EDA-Layoffs.sql**: Performs insights extraction from cleaned data using SQL queries.

## 🔧 Data Cleaning Highlights
1. ✅ Removed duplicate rows using `ROW_NUMBER()`.
2. ✅ Handled blank/NULL values in `industry`, `percentage_laid_off`, and `total_laid_off`.
3. ✅ Trimmed extra spaces and periods from `company` and `country`.
4. ✅ Standardized date format and converted `date` column to `DATE` type.
5. ✅ Standardized industries (e.g., “Crypto”, “Fintech”).
6. ✅ Dropped unnecessary columns (like `row_num`) post-cleaning.
